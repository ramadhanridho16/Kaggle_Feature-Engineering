# Mutual Information Score
Mutual Information (MI) scores typically range from 0 to a positive value, but it's unusual to have a MI score greater than 1. MI measures the dependency or information shared between two variables, and a score above 1 would imply an extremely strong dependency.

In practice, MI scores close to 0 suggest little to no dependency or information sharing between the variables, while higher scores indicate increasing levels of dependency. A score of 1 would typically mean perfect dependency, where knowing the value of one variable completely predicts the other.

If you encounter a Mutual Information score greater than 1, it's essential to examine the calculation and data carefully. Such a high score might suggest issues like data duplication, incorrect data processing, or other anomalies in the dataset or calculation process. Double-check the code, data preprocessing steps, and ensure that the variables being analyzed are correctly defined.

If you're working with a specific dataset or calculation where you're seeing MI scores greater than 1, it would be necessary to investigate the underlying data and code to identify and resolve any issues.
